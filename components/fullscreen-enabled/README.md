# fullscreen-enabled
   
This behavior teaches elements how to use the Fullscreen API.

Just toggle the <code>fullscreen</code> property!

A callback named: <code>_fullscreen_changed(new_value, old_value)</code> is also provided. 


## Dependencies

**This behavior requires that an instance of lodash be instantiated in the global scope prior to its instantiation.**

All dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install
